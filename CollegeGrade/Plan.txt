FRONT END:

2 seperate versions--one for student; one for professor/teacher.

Student version:

a) Nav bar-- one item for each class, plus one showing a general GPA vs time graph.

b) class page: 
 
 Each class page should have a graph which should contain the following:

 1) student grade vs. time

 2) class average vs. time

 3) Functionality for student to set a goal grade (which should turn red or something if grade drops below that)

 Each class page should also have a table of grades

 Also have a predicted grade for the class based on class average and standard deviation.

c) General page:

 1) cumulative GPA vs. time (so includes everything from freshman year)

 2) Predicted GPA for a particular semester based on predicted grades.

 3) Graph of estimated GPA vs. time

d) Functionality to look at the final grades of each class from previous semesters: organized into tables for each semester.

e) Give an e-mail notification when a new grade is posted (which can be turned off)

BACK END:

a) A Database! (Probably the free version of Microsoft SQL server for the prototype)
